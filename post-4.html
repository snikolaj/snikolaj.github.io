                    <h2 class="section-heading">Beta testers</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes things just don’t work out as planned. I planned to have this blog post out by Wednesday. I predicted that my „beta testers“ would finish by then. They didn’t. A few days later they notified me that they had finished. I expected
                        my project to take 2-3 hours to finish, but I didn’t ask them if they did it in one go or over a few days. I can’t thank them enough for offering to do this for free, the feedback they provided is invaluable.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">A big problem</h2>
                    <p>The most common complaint was a feeling of loss of direction. They told me that there are parts that are way too beginner oriented, and some that are way too advanced for a beginner to understand. Now, my code is simple, but I think
                        the way I’m explaining is is not. Unfortunately I don’t believe that this problem is something that I could fix with a few revisions, rather I think I’ll have to rewrite the whole tutorial explaining the project. That’s not a problem,<br>since
                        the explanation is not that large, but it’s something that will somewhat slow down the project.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">How it's going so far</h2>
                    <p>So far, I’ve done the art, the actual game the project is based on, but I will need to rewrite the explanation, and then make it look good with Adobe InDesign. Luckily I haven’t designed the look of the pdf that will be delivered with
                        InDesign, because I was anticipating something like this. Over the next few weeks, I’ll only focus on rewriting it and giving it a sense of direction. Of my<br>three friends that submitted feedback, all of them had managed to finish
                        creating the game, which still means that the explanation was not totally unusable for even the almost-complete-beginner friend that offered to help me. Though, I had intentionally omitted some parts of the game, the game itself
                        is not that complicated. Since this project is supposed to be sort of a mockup of what the full version is (supposed to be in round 3), I didn’t want to go all in and create something that will take way too long to finish. Still,
                        I believe that I’m doing well on time and I’ll have a lot of time to fine tune and make my project submission as good as I can.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">A specific way of writing</h2>
                    <p>An interesting I’ve noticed and had other people tell me is that I have a specific way of writing that people either love or hate. I’ve had teachers that loved it and told me that they loved to read what I wrote, and some hated it
                        and made school a bit miserable. Now, that’s not a problem in school, where the people critiquing you on your way of writing is just a few teachers, but when it’s supposed to be way more people and it’s also for a good cause, then
                        it makes me a bit anxious. Luckily, I believe that a good thing to come out of my specific way of writing is that everyone knows that I wrote it.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Where's the music?!</h2>
                    <p>Another critique I received was that there was no music in the game. Now that’s a problem, because with the art I made it simple using a website so that anyone could make it, but with music it’s a lot more different because not only
                        is music taste subjective, but music has a higher barrier to entry than art. With art, if you can draw, you can just practice drawing and become good with just practice and a good eye. With music, you need to know music theory
                        and you also potentially need to have expensive equipment just to get started. I play the synthesizer, and even the relatively cheap one I have is 300$. I could make the users download a DAW (digital audio workstation) but they
                        have an insanely long list of features and I would have to double the size of the project just to accommodate a DAW learning tutorial. I won’t be doing that, and most likely I’ll leave it as a challenge in the end and maybe put
                        some links to where people can download music to add with a permissive licence. That’s it for today, and next time I’ll be writing about my challenges with InDesign and (re)writing the project.<br></p>
